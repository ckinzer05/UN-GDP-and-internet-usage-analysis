# UN-GDP-and-internet-usage-analysis
An exploration analysis using Python(packages:Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) to perform exploration analysis of UN data in regards to GDP and Internet usage globally. 

Data provided by the UN each data set has a country, year, and value column for analysis. Since the GDP data and Internet Usage Data sets were seperate files, the data had to be Merged to efficiently analyze the data. 

From the analysis it was found that GDP doesnt always necessarily correlate with internet usage.
